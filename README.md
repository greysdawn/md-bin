# md-bin

A personal use pastebin-style holder for markdown. **Old and not currently maintained**

If you want to use this code for yourself, here are some notes:
- You'll have to uncomment the `app.listen` line at the bottom. Replace the port there with your preferred port (or leave it as is) *unless* you're using it as an app with vhost
- There's no way to add, remove, edit, or list users through the website itself right now, so you'll have to either use the API to add them or populate the database yourself
- Some of it is a little janky, fair warning
- Only users can create, edit, delete, list, etc posts. Non-users can see them when directly linked however
